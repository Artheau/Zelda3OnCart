1) Every successful project needs a goal (if it can be finished), or a mission statement (if it has no obvious end).

2) It is a privilege to have an audience.  Community is a thing to encourage.

3) Don't be so afraid of breaking things that you never change anything.

4) Fun should not be the victim of competition or purism.  A game can evolve beyond its roots.

5) Don't break the game in an attempt to prevent people from cheating or exploiting bugs.

6) Make a mechanism to transfer ownership/responsibility of coding projects to new individuals over time.  No one person ever satisfactorily works on the same thing forever.
