!ROM_NAME = "THE LEGEND OF ZELDA"    ;max 21 characters, will be padded by spaces

!END_OF_ROM = "$3fffff"   ;used to expand the ROM, and to fill

!SCREEN_HEIGHT = "$E0"

!BIG_TILE_HEIGHT = "$10"   ;for code readability, mostly.  I don't recommend changing this

!DIALOGUE_MASH_DELAY_TIMER = "$40"   ;prevents the user from rapidly pressing the A button to accidentally advance through dialogue
